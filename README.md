# STM32-LCD-I2C-DHT22
STM32 Nucleo-C031C6 I2C DHT22 with LCD Example
## The story

We had simulator a SMT32 Board with a DHT22 sensor and a LCD1602 I2C display. DHT22 Read data each 3 seconds. Temperature and Humidity will be displayed to the LCD. If temperature lager than 30 degree, the Light is turned on, else turn on.
## Simulation
### Temperature under 30 degree
LCD display data from DHT22
